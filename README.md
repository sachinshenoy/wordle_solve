# Wordle_Solve

Wordle_Solve is a script written in Python using the selenium module to try and solve the daily Wordle puzzle by taking control of the browser instance on your system. This has only been tested on Windows 10 in light and dark mode. The WordsAPI hosted on RapidAPI was used to generate a Zipf distribution frequency score for each word in the Wordle word collection; which is then used to select the best guess for the next word from list condensed based on the results of the previous guesses.
